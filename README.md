Just wrapped up a new Power BI project: Amazon Prime Video Dashboard ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š
I'm excited to share a dynamic and interactive dashboard I built to analyze and visualize insights from Amazon Prime Video's content library. This dashboard offers a clear overview of key metrics like:
âœ… Total number of titles, genres, and directors
 âœ… Breakdown of ratings and genre distribution
 âœ… Movie vs TV show comparison
 âœ… Country-wise and yearly content trends
 âœ… And more, all in a clean and interactive layout
This project was a great opportunity to apply data visualization and storytelling techniques to a real-world streaming dataset. Power BI's rich visuals and powerful DAX functions made it possible to bring the data to life in a way that's both informative and engaging.
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Make data-driven decisions easier for stakeholders in the streaming industry by uncovering trends and content performance at a glance.
